We are human beings shaped by different places, environments, schools, and upbringings. Yet in order to communicate with one another, we need a shared language. A shared language requires shared definitions — they form the foundation of meaningful communication.

Today, we live in a world where we interact with AI chatbots and build automated systems composed of agents — large language models enhanced with the ability to use specific tools. These systems can retrieve information from various sources, make decisions, and perform actions while we focus on other tasks.

LLM stands for “Large Language Model,” and the key word in this term is “language.” This brings to mind my time at the University of Wrocław, especially the first lecture on the mathematical definition of language.

## What is the “language”?

My favorite definition of “language” is a mathematical definition like “set of words over the alphabet”. While this definition focuses on formal language, it is incredibly precise and this definition is extremely exact about what language is and should be.

Language is kind of code that is fundamentally used to communicate between a transmitter and a receiver, a concept emphasized in The Mathematical Theory of Communication by C. E. Shannon

The Mathematical Theory of Communication by C. E. Shannon

Language acts as a code transmitted between two or more interested objects. This occurs between:

- People - between two or more people, or
- Machines - between two or more machines, devices, or software services (such as notebooks, servers, or AI agents), or
- Mixed environment - between people and machines, devices, or software services

This code can take many forms, including:

- Natural language, or
- Graphical language, or
- National languages like English, French, German, Spanish, Polish, Ukrainian, Chinese, or more, or
- Mathematical language,
- Programming languages like BCDL, B, C, Assembler, Java, PHP, Python, JS, TS, Kotlin, Scala, Go, C++, F#, C#, VisualBasic, COBOL, Fortran, and many more, or
- Cipher language

## Eliminating Noise

As we can see in all pictures, the noise is trying to penetrate, distort, or completely prevent the correct transmission of information.

This kind of noise can be everything, for example:

- Weather interference (Wind, snow, rain)
- Losing network packets
- Misunderstandings
- Insufficient knowledge
- Wrong pixels in visual transmissions
- Braking connections
- AI hallucinations
- and more…


Organizations and teams must strive to eliminate this noise in daily basis as much as possible to facilitate effective cooperation among team members and customers

## How should it solve this?

* **First**, when you decide to hire a new employee, you should be extraordinarily sure that he or she is using proper language and is open for feedback. This new employee should have the required competencies and knowledge, culture, and language to smoothly communicate with the team. Even if you are a good employer open to hiring juniors, I think that should be a standard - while onboarding process - to prepare team workshops or educational paths to assess if the employee is ready to start his first task. I think that kind of internal course/workshop should be an international standard in IT driven by international law.
* **Second**, when you receive a signal that the employee is not ready to work, please invest in him or her to suggest taking part in the tailored courses/workshops/certificates still focused on communication in technology instead of technical skills that he misunderstood the business needs or requirements from customer processes.
* **Third**, tools, organization, and management frameworks - they are the last part of the solution because, as the Agile Manifesto says (in the first row: “Individuals and interactions over processes and tools“), they are not so essential because your people, your employees (even B2B contracted), create your brand and help your business and increase your position in business relations. Tools, organization, and management frameworks should only help to clarify communication between interested sides. I’m convinced that business success is based on trust and teamwork instead of independence and untrusted single units in corporate culture.

## Last, but not least… Sum up.

To sum up above solutions and conclusions, as I wrote that we are in different spaces, places, countries, raising environments, but everything what we make in our companies, we need to talk. We need the common code to deliver message from transmitter to receivers is using common **language** from business perspectives up to technical namespace and solution.

We need to use the same words and have the same knowledge to understand themselves and deliver business value to our customers. The best advice is to invest time and spent more time now to increase time at future. Each success based on **the communication** and is so important to take care and improve it when sometimes fails by preparing workshops, courses, couching, mentoring.
