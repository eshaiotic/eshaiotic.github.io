For many years, my first blog idea was a web log of solutions that were difficult to figure out, extremely time-consuming to find on the web, or that nobody had written an article about. Some problems are described in so many words — I wanted to simplify them.

Nowadays, I have decided to change my image and approach by occasionally sharing solutions, and at work I mentor a team of junior and mid-level developers. The main inspiration to create  a fresh blog came when I returned to books I hadn't fully read — like "The C Programming Language" (ANSI C) — and decided to take an engineering approach to compare performance and share knowledge in a different way. I think it will not be tutorials or courses, but rather a kind of guide featuring tests, summaries, charts, and benchmarks — as measurable as possible —  instead of religious concepts.

This blog is about Engineering and Computing, focused on Programming Languages, Computer Science, Design Patterns, Best Practices, Software Architecture, Cybersecurity, Project Management, International Standardisation, SRE. And in the future maybe I will expand it to cover Electronics and Electric solutions like IoT or HomeAutomation.

In this blog, I take an approach more based on sources, facts, measurements, and a more scientific perspective — explaining topics from simple language up to scientific language — to refresh my knowledge of scientific terminology and do some research. For some topics, I need to learn myself before I write about them. On the other hand, I share my opinions on some subjects — I hope that it makes "the camp (IT world) better than I found it."
